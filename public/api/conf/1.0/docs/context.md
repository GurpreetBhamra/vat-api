Making Tax Digital introduces digital record keeping for VAT registered businesses, those that are above the VAT threshold will be mandated to use this service from April 2019. HMRC customers (and their agents) will use digital record keeping software to interact directly with our systems via the MTD APIs.

The MTD VAT API allows software packages to supply business financial data to HMRC, so taxpayers can fulfil their obligations.

### How it works 

* the taxpayer (or their agent) enters their VAT account information into the software
* the software updates HMRC via the API
* the API submits this information to a HMRC systems database, where the customers liability is stored to establish the taxpayer's obligations have been met
